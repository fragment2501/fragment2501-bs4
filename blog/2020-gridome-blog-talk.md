this whole experiment came from my experience with building web apps at work:
- Coldfusion with oracle backend
- ASPX pages and MVC5 apps with oracle and sql server backends
- Sharepoint with sql server backend
- drupal8 with mysql backend.

Building on these platforms isnt bad at all. 
But having to manage apps end to end on these platforms, you start to seeing the same issues over and over again.
- Keeping servers patched and secure over time.
- Scaling issues with backend servers as load increases over time.
- Maintaining complex back end infrastructure over time (firewalls/loadbalancers/caching servers/web servers,database servers)
