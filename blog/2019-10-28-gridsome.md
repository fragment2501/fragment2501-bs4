Testing out [Gridsome](https://gridsome.org) for my old dead blog.  Maybe this will get me into writing again? :O

I had migrated from blogger to jekyll a while back and tossed it up on github pages.  Now I've taken that jekyll post content and moved it into gridsome and put up a site on netlify to test it out. Loving the netlify workflow and it's hooks into github.
