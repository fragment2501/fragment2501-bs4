I used the ooni pizza app to get a baseline of ingredients, then just kept tweaking it until I got a good dough going.

## Ingredients
- 306g flour 
    - 50g whole wheat flour
    - 50g spelt flour
    - 200g all purpose flour (or 00 if you have it)
- 183g water
- 5g salt
- 1/4th cup sourdough starter
- 5g oil

## Method
1. Mix water, salt and starter in a large bowl.
1. Add 50g whole wheat flour, 50g spelt flour and 100g all purpose flour and mix by hand until you have a wet dough.
1. Cover with plastic wrap and let sit in a warm place overnight. The dough should double in size in the bowl.
1. Add oil and mix in the rest of the flour 1/4th cup at a time.
1. Kneed the dough into a ball, let rest covered in the bowl for another 2 hours.
1. Split into 2 or 3 dough balls - use right away or stash in the fridge. They should keep for a few days.
